## 1. Input Datasets and Experiment Setup

Fifteen graphs were used to test **Primâ€™s** and **Kruskalâ€™s** algorithms.  
They were divided by size and density:

| Category | Graph IDs | Vertices Range | Typical Edges | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Small** | 1â€“5 | 4â€“6 | 5â€“8 | Debugging, correctness |
| **Medium** | 6â€“10 | 10â€“15 | 30â€“50 | Performance comparison |
| **Large** | 11â€“15 | 20â€“30+ | 70â€“100+ | Scalability testing |

All graphs were stored in `assign_3_input.json`, and results were written into `assign_3_output.json`.

## 3. Average Metrics by Graph Category

| Category | Avg Vertices | Avg Edges | Avg Prim Ops | Avg Kruskal Ops | Avg Time Prim (ms) | Avg Time Kruskal (ms) |
|-----------|--------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Small (1â€“5) | 5.2 | 5.8 | **36** | **56.6** | 0 | 0.2 |
| Medium (6â€“10) | 13 | 38.8 | **530.8** | **328.8** | 0 | 0.4 |
| Large (11â€“15) | 25.8 | 83.8 | **2216.2** | **749.4** | 0.4 | 0.4 |

**Observations:**
- Operation counts clearly increase with graph size.
- Primâ€™s algorithm grows much faster as graphs get bigger.
- Kruskalâ€™s algorithm scales better on large inputs.

---

## 4. Operation Growth Ratios

| Graph Size | Prim/Kruskal Operation Ratio | Interpretation |
|-------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| Small | ~0.65 | Almost equal performance |
| Medium | ~1.6 | Prim is 60% slower |
| Large | ~3.0 | Kruskal is about 3Ã— faster |

---

## 5. Efficiency by Graph Density

| Density Type | Example Graph | Edges/Vertices Ratio | Faster Algorithm |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Sparse | 4, 5, 6 | ~3â€“4 | **Kruskal** |
| Medium | 7â€“9 | ~4â€“5 | **Kruskal (by 30â€“40%)** |
| Dense | 10, 11, 14 | >6 | **Prim comparable but slower** |

---

##  6. Theoretical vs Practical Trends

| Algorithm | Expected Complexity | Observed Growth | Match |
|------------|--------------------|------------------|--------|
| **Primâ€™s** | O(VÂ²) | Quadratic increase in operations | Matches |
| **Kruskalâ€™s** | O(E log E) | Log-linear growth with edges |  Matches |

ðŸ“ˆ **Empirical Validation Chart**

![Empirical MST Validation](src/main/resources/mst_validation_full.png)

The dashed theoretical lines represent expected time complexity:
- Blue dashed â†’ Primâ€™s O(VÂ²)
- Red dashed â†’ Kruskalâ€™s O(E log E)

Real measured points follow the same pattern, confirming correctness.

## 7. Practical Behavior Comparison

| Factor | Primâ€™s Algorithm | Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Performance on small graphs | Very fast | Similar performance |
| Performance on large graphs | Slower due to vertex iteration | Faster, scalable |
| Implementation simplicity | Easier to code | Slightly more complex (sorting + union-find) |
| Memory usage | Slightly lower | Slightly higher |
| Preferred graph type | Dense networks | Sparse networks |
| MST cost consistency | Always same | Always same |

---

## 8. Empirical Observations Summary

| Metric | Prim (avg) | Kruskal (avg) | Difference |
|--------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Execution time (ms) | 0.1 | 0.15 | Almost equal |
| Operation count | 927 | 441 | Prim uses ~2.1Ã— more ops |
| MST total cost | Identical | Identical | same MST |
| Cycle-free | Yes | Yes |  verified |
| Connected graphs handled | Yes | Yes |  consistent |

---

##  9. Empirical Validation Discussion

- Primâ€™s operations grow approximately **VÂ²**, consistent with theory.
- Kruskalâ€™s scales as **E log E**, since sorting dominates complexity.
- For **dense** graphs, Prim can perform similarly.
- For **sparse** or **large** graphs, Kruskal clearly outperforms.

The measured data perfectly align with theoretical expectations, confirming the correctness and efficiency of both implementations.

---

## 10. Conclusions

1. Both algorithms produce **identical MST costs** and number of edges.
2. **Primâ€™s** algorithm has **O(VÂ²)** growth and works better on **dense graphs**.
3. **Kruskalâ€™s** algorithm scales **O(E log E)** and is better for **sparse or large graphs**.
4. The **empirical validation** confirms theoretical predictions.
5. In practice:
    - Use **Prim** for small or complete networks.
    - Use **Kruskal** for large or sparse networks (faster and more scalable).
